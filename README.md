## Books

* **["Hands–On Machine Learning with Scikit–Learn and TensorFlow 2e: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems."](https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=tensorflow&qid=1598403055&sr=8-2)**

Through a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how.

* **["Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python"](https://www.amazon.com.br/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=data+science+from+scratch&qid=1598403146&sr=8-3)**

Data science libraries, frameworks, modules, and toolkits are great for doing data science, but they’re also a good way to dive into the discipline without actually understanding data science. In this book, you’ll learn how many of the most fundamental data science tools and algorithms work by implementing them from scratch.

* **["Essential Math for Data Science: Take Control of Your Data with Fundamental Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics"](https://www.amazon.com.br/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098115562/ref=sr_1_26?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=o%27reilly&qid=1598403551&sr=8-26)**

Master the math needed to excel in data science and machine learning. If you're a data scientist who lacks a math or scientific background or a developer who wants to add data domains to your skillset, this is your book. Author Hadrien Jean provides you with a foundation in math for data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

* **["Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning: Creating and Deploying Deep Learning Applications"](https://www.amazon.com.br/Programming-PyTorch-Deep-Learning-Pointer/dp/1492045357/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=deep+learning+with+pytorch&qid=1598403985&sr=8-3)**

Take the next steps toward mastering deep learning, the machine learning method that's transforming the world around us by the second. In this practical book, you'll get up to speed on key ideas using Facebook's open source PyTorch framework and gain the latest skills you need to create your very own neural networks.
